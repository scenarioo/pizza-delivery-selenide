# pizza-delivery-selenide

Simple Demo for using Selenide to test a simple pizza shop web application.

For Selenide see https://selenide.org/

This example demonstrates the following
* using Selenide to write nice tests
* using page objects in your Selenide tests to structure them well (use business language!)
* (coming later: using scenarioo to produce a feature rich test documentation for your web tests)

## Browsing test reports

You can see sample Scenarioo Documentation Reports generated by this example tests in the Scenarioo Viewer here:
[Pizza Delivery Scenarioo Documenation](http://demo.scenarioo.org/scenarioo-master/#/?branch=pizza-delivery-master)

## How To Run

```
git clone https://github.com/scenarioo/pizza-delivery-selenide.git
cd pizza-delivery-selenide
./gradlew test
```

== TODO not working yet: ==

Scenarioo documentation data is located in `build\scenariooDocumentation` after the test run has finished. In order to browse the data in the Scenarioo Viewer you need to setup the viewer as described in [Setup of Scenarioo Viewer Web App](http://scenarioo.org/docs/master/tutorial/Scenarioo-Viewer-Web-Application-Setup.html).

## JUnit 5

This example is in JUnit 5 only. We recommend to use Junit 5 and not Junit 4 anymore (although it would also work in Junit 4 by using the good old JUnit rules).

## Application Under Test

The application under test is a very simple pizza ordering web app without a dynamic backend. Taken from our pure Selenium example here: 
https://github.com/scenarioo/pizza-delivery

If you want to experience the pizza ordering awesomeness on your own, you can order your pizzas here: [Pizza Delivery Web Shop](http://scenarioo.github.io/pizza-delivery/).

**Usage hint:** The only known phone number is 0791111111, all other phone numbers require you to enter a new delivery address. And don't wory, there is no backend, so no one will bring you a pizza or send you a bill or call you to sell you more. ;-)
